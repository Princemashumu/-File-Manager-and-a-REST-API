# 📃 Shopping List Manager & 📁 File Manager API

### 🌐 Overview
This Node.js application serves as both a basic File Manager and a REST API for managing a shopping list. It leverages Node.js' file system capabilities to store shopping list data in JSON format and exposes CRUD operations via HTTP endpoints. The application ensures data management through a JSON file, enabling users to add, update, delete, and retrieve shopping list items.

# ✨ Features
### 📂 File Manager

- ✅ **Create a new directory**: Initializes a directory to store the shopping list data.
- ✅ **Create a JSON file**: Generates a `shopping-list.json` file within the directory to hold shopping list items.
- ✅ **Read and parse the JSON file**: Reads and parses the JSON data for easy manipulation.
- ✅ **Update the JSON file**: Saves new or updated shopping list items to the file.

### 📖 Shopping List API
- ✅ **CRUD Operations**: Supports creating, reading, updating, and deleting shopping list items using HTTP methods.
- ✅ **GET /shopping-list**: Retrieve all shopping list items.
- ✅ **POST /shopping-list**: Add a new item to the shopping list.
- ✅ **PUT /shopping-list/:id**: Update an existing item in the shopping list.
- ✅ **DELETE /shopping-list/:id**: Remove an item from the shopping list.
- ⚠️ **Error Handling and Validation**: Ensures that data is validated before storage and handles errors gracefully.

### ⚙️ Requirements
- 💻 **Node.js (v12+)**
- 📝 **Postman** or a similar tool for API testing

### 🛠️ Installation
Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/princemashumu/File-Manager-and-a-REST-API.git
cd File-Manager-and-a-REST-API
```

Install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Start the server:

```bash
node app.js
```

The server will be running on **http://localhost:3000/**.

### 📝 Endpoints

**Request Body**:
```json
{
  "name": "Item Name",
  "quantity": 1
}
```

**Response**:

**Request Body**:
```json
{
  "name": "Updated Item Name",
  "quantity": 2
}
```

### ⚠️ Error Handling & Validation

- ✅ Validates that the `name` field is a non-empty string.
- ✅ Validates that the `quantity` field is a positive number.
- ✅ Returns appropriate HTTP status codes and error messages for invalid data or failed operations.

### 🔧 Testing

- 📝 Use **Postman** or a similar tool to test each endpoint for the CRUD operations.
- 📁 Verify that the file operations (**read, write, update**) are functioning correctly by checking the `shopping-list.json` file in the data directory.

### ⚙️ Future Enhancements

- ⚡ Implement **user authentication** for secure access to the API.
- 💻 Add a **front-end interface** for managing the shopping list.
- 🏛 Store shopping list data in a **database** instead of a JSON file for scalability.
